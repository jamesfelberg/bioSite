        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Kaplan is a junior in high school currently attending Willow Lake High School in South Dakota.  He is active in sports including football and basketball, but basketball is his favorite sport.  During the last season of playing with the Clark Willow Lake Cyclones he was a starter and was selected to be on the All-Conference team in two different conferences.  When he is not going to school or playing basketball Kaplan enjoys playing guitar, both acoustic and electric, spending time with his friends and girlfriend, and playing with his three dogs Clover, Poppy, and Malcom.   Family is important to Kaplan, and you can see him playing basketball in the driveway and passing along his knowledge to his younger brothers.
            Long term goals for Kaplan include attending a college and playing basketball while doing so.  He hopes to graduate with a degree in physical therapy as a way to use his interest in science and human anatomy along with his desire to help people.  Owning and operating his own practice is an ideal goal and usually when Kaplan has desire and determination to accomplish a goal he will work as hard and long as possible in order to achieve that goal.  He has not figured out where he would like to live but would like to live in a bigger city than he grew up in as there will be more opportunity to build a business and wants to be married, have at least three kids, and also wants pure bred dog.  Kaplan is described by his family smart, determined and as his mother would say “He’s just a really good kid.”
